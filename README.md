# Dev-Advocacy-Samples
This GitHub repository contains code samples that demonstrate how you can use Windows for development.

## Samples
The samples contain two tutorials:

- [App development with Node.js using VS Code and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://github.com/Microsoft/Dev-Advocacy-Samples/tree/master/nodejs-shoppingcart)
- [Machine learning with Python using WSL](https://github.com/Microsoft/Dev-Advocacy-Samples/tree/master/python-mlclassification)

You can use this [one-click developer machine setup script](http://boxstarter.org/package/url?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/Dev-Advocacy-Samples/master/dev_setup.ps1) based on [this project](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts) to install the prequisites for the tutorials.

## Contents
Each sample has a README page with a set of instructions that will walk you through the tutorial. The instructions include:
- Story - Tutorial objective
- Prerequisites - System requirements and download instructions.
- Tutorial - Steps walking through a simple end-to-end demo that takes between 10-20 minutes.
- Next Steps - Links to resources on the tutorial topic and associated GitHub repositories.
